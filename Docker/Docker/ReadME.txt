# Docker file for testing COMP6714 17s2 Project-2
# 
# How to use:
#     
#     1. Put YOUR "submission.py" in this directory
#     2. Enter the value for num_steps in the last line of Dockerfile (Enter value = 10 for fast running)
#	 e.g., (CMD [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "python testcode.py 10"])
#     3. Run the following command in this directory to build the test environment
#        (very slow for the first time)
#
#         docker build -t 6714test .
#
#     4. Run the following command to run the test, then you should see the test result
#	 (see Sample Output below)
#
#         docker run --rm 6714test
#
#     5. If you have modified "submission.py", repeat Step 3 and Step 4

	Notes: 
	a. Please ignore warnings generated by Tensorflow Library.
	b. We are using smaller number of training iterations (num_steps = 10) for faster running. For realistic scenario, change num_steps = 100001 in the Dockerfile.
	c. We will test your code in a similar environment. If your code fails to run in this environment, you will get ZERO score.
